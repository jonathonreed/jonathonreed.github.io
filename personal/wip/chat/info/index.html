	<h2>Why?</h2>
	<h3>An origin story</h3>
	<p>
		A few years ago Asad received a postcard which, among other things, said: <i>The best way to get a chair at the table is to build one yourself.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		At the same time, <a href="http://thechairsarewherethepeoplego.com/">The Chairs Are Where the People Go</a> by Sheila Heti was one of his favourite reads and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjKpHnF_sRg">Tables and Chairs</a> by Andrew Bird was one of his favourite listens. Chairs and Tables became a metaphor upon which we layered our understanding of how the world already operated and how, in some ways if we helped, it might. We&rsquo;ve been building mostly metaphorical furniture ever since. (There have been a few stints building, assembling, and rearranging furniture, too.)

	<h2>Who?</h2>
	<h3>The CHAT duo</h3>
	<p>
		<a href="http://asadchishti.com">Asad Chishti</a> is the table+bricoleur and <a href="http://jonathonreed.com">Jonathon Reed</a> is the chair+inventor. Born a few years and several thousand kilometers apart, following their twin sisters, they ended up at the same post-secondary institution. They&rsquo;ve been collaborating ever since, but finally in the same place, on the same project, at the same time.
